# jiyu-d-proto
Jiyu prototype : D lang implementation

## Building

Using the `dub` program, because I don't know any better. To build, use the command `dub build`.

## TODO

We need to generally finalize the **data**, before we split the project into branches.
These branches would be **verification** and **serialization**. Once those two are done we can integrate them
as we work on the **netcode**.

- [ ] **data**
- [ ] **netcode**
- [ ] **verification**
- [ ] **serialization**

We can probably start **netcode** right now but only make minor progress on it
without real **verification** and **serialization**.
